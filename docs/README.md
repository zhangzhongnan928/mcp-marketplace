# MCP Marketplace Documentation

Welcome to the MCP Marketplace documentation. This repository contains comprehensive information about the MCP (Model Context Protocol) Marketplace, its architecture, governance structure, and implementation roadmap.

## What is MCP Marketplace?

MCP Marketplace is a platform that allows developers to create and publish Model Context Protocol (MCP) services that can be easily integrated with AI assistants like Claude and Cursor. It provides a simplified workflow for users to discover, purchase, and immediately use these services within their AI assistants.

The project includes both the technical implementation of the marketplace as well as a decentralized governance and reputation system designed to create a self-sustaining ecosystem.
