## Reputation Domains

### Service Provider Reputation

#### Data Points Collected

| Data Point | Description | Weight | Collection Method |
|------------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| Uptime | Service availability percentage | High | Automated monitoring |
| Response Time | API response latency | Medium | Automated monitoring |
| Error Rate | Percentage of failed requests | High | Automated monitoring |
| Version Updates | Frequency of updates and patches | Low | Repository tracking |
| Security Incidents | Number and severity of issues | Critical | Incident reports |
| Feature Delivery | Meeting roadmap commitments | Medium | Milestone tracking |
| Documentation Quality | Completeness and clarity | Medium | Automated + Manual review |
| Support Responsiveness | Time to respond to issues | High | Support ticket tracking |
| Code Quality | Static analysis metrics | Medium | Automated code review |

#### Reputation Formula

The service provider reputation score (R<sub>sp</sub>) is calculated as:

```
R_sp = (w_u * U + w_rt * RT + w_er * ER + w_vu * VU + w_si * SI + w_fd * FD + w_dq * DQ + w_sr * SR + w_cq * CQ) / Σw
```

Where:
- U = Uptime score (0-100)
- RT = Response time score (0-100)
- ER = Error rate score (0-100)
- VU = Version updates score (0-100)
- SI = Security incidents score (0-100)
- FD = Feature delivery score (0-100)
- DQ = Documentation quality score (0-100)
- SR = Support responsiveness score (0-100)
- CQ = Code quality score (0-100)
- w_x = Weight for each respective component

#### Score Normalization

All raw scores are normalized to a 0-100 scale with non-linear transformations to emphasize differences in the middle range (40-80) where most services will fall.

### User/Reviewer Reputation

#### Data Points Collected

| Data Point | Description | Weight | Collection Method |
|------------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| Review Quality | Detail, helpfulness, and clarity | High | NLP analysis + manual |
| Review Consistency | Variance from other trusted reviews | Medium | Statistical analysis |
| Verification Status | Level of identity verification | High | Account verification |
| Usage Frequency | Activity level on the platform | Low | Usage tracking |
| Review Helpfulness | Votes from other users | Medium | User feedback |
| Review History | Longevity and pattern of reviews | Medium | Historical analysis |
| Community Standing | Participation in governance, etc. | Low | Platform engagement |
| False Positive Rate | Incorrect negative reviews | High | Dispute resolution |
| False Negative Rate | Incorrect positive reviews | High | Dispute resolution |

#### Reputation Formula

The user/reviewer reputation score (R<sub>ur</sub>) is calculated as:

```
R_ur = (w_rq * RQ + w_rc * RC + w_vs * VS + w_uf * UF + w_rh * RH + w_rhi * RHI + w_cs * CS - w_fpr * FPR - w_fnr * FNR) / Σw
```

Where:
- RQ = Review quality score (0-100)
- RC = Review consistency score (0-100)
- VS = Verification status score (0-100)
- UF = Usage frequency score (0-100)
- RH = Review helpfulness score (0-100)
- RHI = Review history score (0-100)
- CS = Community standing score (0-100)
- FPR = False positive rate penalty (0-100)
- FNR = False negative rate penalty (0-100)
- w_x = Weight for each respective component

## Anti-Gaming Mechanisms

### Sybil Resistance

1. **Progressive Trust Building**
   - New accounts start with limited review weight
   - Review influence increases gradually with positive history
   - Sudden spikes in activity trigger automatic review

2. **Identity Verification Layers**
   - Optional KYC for higher trust levels
   - Social graph verification
   - Proof-of-personhood implementation
   - Economic staking requirements

3. **Behavioral Analysis**
   - Pattern detection for coordinated reviews
   - IP and device fingerprinting
   - Timing analysis of actions
   - Natural language processing to detect fake reviews

### Review Quality Assurance

1. **NLP-Based Analysis**
   - Sentiment analysis to detect extreme opinions
   - Content analysis to verify substantive feedback
   - Plagiarism detection
   - Experience verification through detail analysis

2. **Statistical Anomaly Detection**
   - Outlier detection for ratings
   - Sudden changes in reputation patterns
   - Unusual timing or volume of reviews
   - Correlation analysis between reviewers

3. **Community Oversight**
   - Flagging system for suspicious reviews
   - Expert reviewer program
   - Review audits by governance participants
   - Dispute resolution process

## Weighted Reputation Calculations

Reviews are weighted based on multiple factors:

1. **Reviewer Reputation**
   - Higher reputation reviewers have more impact

2. **Review Freshness**
   - Recent reviews have more weight than older ones
   - Exponential decay function: `weight = base_weight * e^(-λt)`
   - Where t is time in days and λ is the decay constant

3. **Review Detail Level**
   - Quantified by length, specificity, and structured feedback
   - Detail score is normalized on a 0-100 scale

4. **Verification Status**
   - Verified purchases receive higher weight
   - Proof of extended usage increases weight

The final review weight is calculated as:

```
review_weight = reviewer_reputation * freshness_factor * detail_factor * verification_factor
```

## On-Chain Implementation

The reputation system will have both on-chain and off-chain components:

### On-Chain Components

1. **Reputation Registry Contract**
   - Stores the current reputation scores for services and users
   - Immutable history of reputation changes
   - Access control for authorized updates

2. **Review Storage Contract**
   - Stores review hashes and metadata
   - Links reviews to specific services
   - Maintains reviewer attribution

3. **Dispute Resolution Contract**
   - Manages the process for contesting reviews
   - Holds stakes during disputes
   - Executes outcomes of resolved disputes

4. **Governance Integration**
   - Parameter updates through governance
   - System upgrade proposals
   - Emergency intervention mechanisms

### Off-Chain Components
