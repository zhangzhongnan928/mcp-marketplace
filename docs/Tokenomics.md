## Token Allocation

| Category | Percentage | Tokens | Vesting |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Community & Ecosystem** | 40% | 40,000,000 | Variable (see below) |
| **Team & Advisors** | 20% | 20,000,000 | 3-year vesting, 1-year cliff |
| **DAO Treasury** | 20% | 20,000,000 | Controlled by governance |
| **Initial Contributors** | 10% | 10,000,000 | 2-year vesting, 6-month cliff |
| **Early Backers** | 10% | 10,000,000 | 1-year vesting, 3-month cliff |

### Community & Ecosystem Breakdown

| Subcategory | Percentage of Total | Tokens | Distribution Method |
|---|---|---|---|
| User Rewards | 15% | 15,000,000 | Earned through platform activity |
| Developer Incentives | 10% | 10,000,000 | Allocated to service developers |
| Reviewer Rewards | 5% | 5,000,000 | Earned through quality reviews |
| Liquidity Mining | 5% | 5,000,000 | Protocol-owned liquidity |
| Grants Program | 5% | 5,000,000 | Distributed through grants program |

## Vesting and Release Schedule

To ensure long-term alignment of incentives and prevent market disruption, tokens will be released according to the following schedule:

### Team & Advisors (3-year vesting, 1-year cliff)
- 0% at launch
- 25% after 1 year
- Remaining 75% vested linearly over the next 2 years

### DAO Treasury
- 20% available at launch for initial operations
- 80% unlocked through governance votes over time

### Initial Contributors (2-year vesting, 6-month cliff)
- 0% at launch
- 15% after 6 months
- Remaining 85% vested linearly over the next 18 months

### Early Backers (1-year vesting, 3-month cliff)
- 0% at launch
- 20% after 3 months
- Remaining 80% vested linearly over the next 9 months

### Community & Ecosystem
- Released based on specific program parameters
- User rewards and developer incentives distributed continuously
- Reviewer rewards released based on review quality and volume
- Liquidity mining allocated over a 3-year period
- Grants program distributed based on governance decisions

## Token Generation Event

The token generation event (TGE) will make a small percentage of tokens available to the public. The details are as follows:

- **Initial Circulating Supply**: 5% of total supply (5,000,000 MCPT)
- **Initial Price**: To be determined based on market conditions
- **Distribution Method**: To be determined (options include IDO, IEO, or community sale)

## Token Economics

### Fee Structure
- **Platform Fee**: 5% of service subscription revenue
- **Fee Distribution**:
  - 30% to platform maintenance and development
  - 50% to service developers
  - 10% to token holders (proportional to stake)
  - 10% to reviewer rewards pool

### Staking Mechanisms
- **Governance Staking**: Lock tokens to participate in governance (with weight proportional to time locked)
- **Security Staking**: Stake tokens to validate services and reviews
- **Developer Staking**: Developers stake tokens to list services (with stake proportional to service pricing)

### Burning Mechanism
- 10% of platform fees directed to token burning
- Tokens used for premium features partially burned
- Unsuccessful governance proposals have a minimal fee that is burned

## Governance Weighting

To balance the needs of all stakeholders, voting power is not simply proportional to token holdings:

### Quadratic Voting
- Voting power scales with the square root of tokens staked
- Reduces the influence of large token holders
- Encourages broader participation

### Lock-up Bonuses
- Longer lock-up periods provide voting weight multipliers
- 1 month: 1x multiplier
- 3 months: 1.5x multiplier
- 6 months: 2x multiplier
- 12 months: 3x multiplier

### Reputation Factors
- Active contributors receive voting weight bonuses
- Marketplace reputation influences voting power
- Consistent participation in governance increases influence

## Economic Sustainability

The MCPT token economics are designed for long-term sustainability through several mechanisms:

### Revenue Streams
- Platform fees from service subscriptions
- Premium features for token holders
- Integration fees from MCP clients
- Developer tools and services

### Treasury Management
- Active management of DAO treasury assets
- Diversification into stable assets
- Investment in ecosystem growth
- Maintenance of emergency reserve fund

### Value Capture
- Fee distribution to token holders
- Burning mechanism reducing supply over time
- Utility value from governance and platform benefits
- Reputation value from verified status

## Supply Dynamics

### Inflation
- No built-in inflation after initial supply
- Any future inflation requires governance approval with high thresholds
- Potential inflation capped at 2% annually

### Deflation
- Regular burning from platform fees
- Additional burning from premium features
- One-time burning events possible through governance

## Token Migration Path

The token is designed with the possibility of future migration to alternative blockchain infrastructure:

- Initial deployment on Ethereum or EVM-compatible chain
- Bridge to other chains for lower transaction costs
- Eventual migration possibility to custom chain or Layer 2
- Migration decisions controlled by governance

## Risk Mitigation

### Market Volatility
- Treasury diversification
- Protocol-owned liquidity
- Fee accumulation in stable assets

### Centralization Risk
- Quadratic voting
- Maximum voting power caps
- Anti-whale mechanisms

### Regulatory Considerations
- Utility-focused design
- Decentralized distribution
- Transparent governance

## Key Performance Indicators

The following metrics will be used to evaluate the health of the token economy:

- Token velocity (turnover rate)
- Staking ratio (% of supply staked)
- Governance participation rate
- Fee generation and distribution
- Token holder distribution (Gini coefficient)

## Conclusion

The MCPT token is designed to create a sustainable economic model that aligns the incentives of all participants in the MCP Marketplace ecosystem. By balancing governance rights, economic benefits, and access privileges, the token serves as the foundation for a community-owned platform that can grow and evolve over time.

This tokenomics model will be regularly reviewed and can be adjusted through governance decisions to ensure it continues to serve the needs of the community.
