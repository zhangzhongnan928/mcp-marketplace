## Risk Analysis and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Smart contract vulnerabilities**: Multiple audits, bug bounties, gradual rollout
- **Scalability issues**: Load testing, modular architecture, upgrade paths
- **Integration failures**: Comprehensive testing, fallback options, backward compatibility

### Economic Risks
- **Token value volatility**: Reserve fund, token utility, vesting schedules
- **Inadequate incentives**: Regular economic analysis, adjustable parameters
- **Sustainability challenges**: Diversified revenue streams, lean operations

### Governance Risks
- **Voter apathy**: Education, simplified voting, delegation options
- **Centralization**: Quadratic voting, stake limits, active monitoring
- **Governance attacks**: Security thresholds, time delays, constitutional constraints

### Regulatory Risks
- **Token classification**: Legal opinions, regulatory engagement, compliance framework
- **Data privacy concerns**: Privacy by design, user control, minimized data collection
- **Cross-border complications**: Jurisdictional analysis, regional adaptations
